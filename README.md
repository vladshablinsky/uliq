# uliq

uliq is a command line tool for managing your lists.
uliq is just a random name picked by combinig "unique" and "list".

I find it annoying when I have a lot of things to remember and I don't remember all of them so sometimes my list of thins that I have to remember have duplicates. Duplicates annoy me. For me one of the useful cases for this tools is words. English is not my native language, even if it was one, sometimes you don't know the definition of the word and you just "push back" new word to your list of words and don't even guess, that you could encounter the same word before. With `uliq` I want to warn/notify myself, that I already have the word in my list, so probably I should pay more attention to remembering it. I don't know, maybe even the fact that you already have the word in your list somehow stimulates your brain not to forget the word.

I think described above usecase is not the only one, at least for me.

TODO
